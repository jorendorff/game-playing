# Alternate futures: game-playing programs in JS

This is a talk I gave at some local meetups and again at Nodevember 2015.

[See the NashJS video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJQytKx-q40&feature=youtu.be&t=3472) (This video is a little rough. If it is still late 2015 when you read this, that might mean that better video is forthcoming, from [Nodevember](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7z0nOE8ITfrGnXJgNzYaEQ). If not, I've been remiss in updating this - sorry!)
